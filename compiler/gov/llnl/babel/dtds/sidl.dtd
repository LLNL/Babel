   This file describes the DTD for a SIDL symbol represented in XML format.
   The root element is <Symbol>.

   PUBLIC ID "-//CCA//sidl Symbol DTD v1.3//EN"
-->

<!--
   Symbol Element

   Symbol is the root element for all SIDL XML schema.  The Symbol contains a
   SymbolName (fully qualified symbol name and version), Metadata, Comment,
   and one of Class, Enumeration, Interface, or Package.
-->

<!ENTITY % symbols "Class | Enumeration | Interface | Package | Struct">
<!ELEMENT Symbol (SymbolName, Metadata, Comment, (%symbols;))>

<!--
   SymbolName Element

   A SymbolName represents a fully qualified symbol name along with its
   version.  It is of the form:

   <SymbolName name="sidl.SomeName" version="1.3.4"/>
-->

<!ELEMENT SymbolName EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST SymbolName name     CDATA #REQUIRED
                     version  CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Metadata Element

   The Metadata element contains any useful descriptive data about the symbol.
   The time and date of creation is required, but all other information is
   optional.  The date and time must follow the ISO-8601 standard.  The
   entries in the metadata element are (key,value) pairs.
-->

<!ELEMENT Metadata (MetadataEntry)*>
<!ATTLIST Metadata date CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT MetadataEntry EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST MetadataEntry key   CDATA #REQUIRED
                        value CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Comment Element

   Comment elements support a very simple HTML description using the
   html-lite.dtd HTML subset.  See html-lite.dtd for more details.
-->

<!ENTITY % html-lite PUBLIC "-//CCA//sidl HTML DTD v1.0//EN" "html-lite.dtd">
%html-lite;

<!ELEMENT Comment %html-block;>

<!--
   Package Element

   The Package element contains the symbols that exist within a package.
   In the PackageSymbol element, note that the name is relative to the
   package (thus, sidl.Class is represented by Class within package sidl).

   A true final attribute indicates that this package is not reentrant. It
   defaults to true to handle old XML files. In previous versions, all
   packages were non-reentrant.
-->

<!ELEMENT Package (Attributes?, PackageSymbol)*>

<!ELEMENT Attributes (Attribute)* >

<!ELEMENT Attribute EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Attribute name CDATA          #REQUIRED
		    value CDATA         #IMPLIED>

<!--
If the version attribute isn't provided, the symbol has the same version
as the containing package. This is to provide backward compatibility with
previous released versions of the DTD. Someday the version may become
REQUIRED, so always include it.
-->
<!ELEMENT PackageSymbol EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST PackageSymbol name CDATA                               #REQUIRED
                        type (class | enum| interface | package | struct) #REQUIRED

<!ELEMENT Struct (Attributes?, StructItem*) >

<!ELEMENT StructItem (Type) >
<!ATTLIST StructItem name CDATA					#REQUIRED>

<!--
   Enumeration Element

   The Enumeration element consists of a collection of Enumerator elements
   that describe a relative symbol name, its integer value, and whether the
   value was assigned by the parser or in the SIDL input file.
-->

<!ELEMENT Enumeration (Attributes?, Enumerator+) >

<!ELEMENT Enumerator (Comment)?>
<!ATTLIST Enumerator name     CDATA          #REQUIRED
                     value    CDATA          #REQUIRED
                     fromuser (false | true) #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Class Element

   The Class element consists of a class extended by this class, a block
   of interfaces implemented by this class, and a block of methods declared
   or defined by this class.  The methods block does not include methods
   declared or defined by parents.  The elements AllParentInterfaces and
   AllParentClasses include all parents of this class.
-->

<!ELEMENT Class (Attributes?, Extends, ImplementsBlock,
                 AllParentClasses, AllParentInterfaces,
                 MethodsBlock, Contract?)>

<!ELEMENT Extends (SymbolName)?>

<!ELEMENT ImplementsBlock (SymbolName)*>

<!--
   Interface Element

   The Interface element consists of a block of interfaces that this
   interface extends (element ExtendsBlock) and a block of methods
   declared by this interface (element MethodsBlock).  The methods block
   element contains only those methods declared or re-declared by this
   interface and does not include all those methods defined by the
   parent interfaces.  The AllParentInterfaces element block includes
   all parent interfaces that this interface extends.
-->

<!ELEMENT Interface (Attributes?, ExtendsBlock, AllParentInterfaces,
                     MethodsBlock, Contract?)>

<!ELEMENT ExtendsBlock (SymbolName)*>

<!--
   AllParentClasses and AllParentInterfaces Elements

   These elements define a collection of zero or more SymbolName elements
   that are the parent classes and parent interfaces of a class or interface.
-->

<!ELEMENT AllParentClasses (SymbolName)*>

<!ELEMENT AllParentInterfaces (SymbolName)*>

<!--
   MethodsBlock Element

   The MethodsBlock element defines a collection of zero or more methods
   that belong to a SIDL interface or class.
-->

<!ELEMENT MethodsBlock (Method)*>

<!--
   Method Element

   The Method element defines the signature for a single method in a class or
   interface.  The name of the method is obtained from the shortname.  If
   method name overloading is not supported, the extension is appended to the
   short name to build the method name.

                   name CDATA              #REQUIRED>

<!--
   Type Element

   The Type element describes a SIDL type, which may be a built-in type
   such as boolean or int, an array, or a user-defined symbol.  If the
   type description is a primitive type, then no sub-elements are allowed.
   If the type is a symbol, then the single sub-element must be a symbol
   name.  If the type is an array, then the single sub-element must be
   an array element
-->

<!ENTITY % simpletypes "boolean | char | double | float | integer | long | string" >
<!ELEMENT Type (SymbolName | Array)?>

   MethodCall Element

   The SIDL Method Call element defines a method call assertion expression.
   Note that any arguments must be within the scope of the assertion.  For
   invariants, expressions can only contain literals (i.e., NO state or
   attributes).  For methods, expressions can also contain any arguments
   that are being passed to the method.
