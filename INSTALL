Introduction
============

  This document is a slightly expanded GNU Install file.  In
addition to the generic GNU installation instructions, we have
included the software requirements for building the Babel 
toolkit.  For more information about this distribution, Babel,
and contacting the developers, refer to the README.md file contained 
in this directory.


Requirements
============

  Below is a list of language and make requirements for building
the Babel toolkit.  When multiple compilers are listed (e.g., 
Fortran), only one version for the specified platform is necessary.

  o  Languages
     C:         Any recent version of the standard 
                (Technically any ISO/IEC 9899;1999 compatible 
                should work.)
     C++:       GCC Version 3.2 or higher
     Fortran 77: g77 3.2 (or higher)
                 f77 Sun WorkShop Compilers 5.0 (Solaris 2.7)
	        (use --disable-fortran77 if no f77 compiler)
     Fortran 90: Intel 7.0, Lahey, GNU gfortran, PathScale, or Absoft
		(most compilers supported by libchasmlite)
		(use --disable-fortran90 if no F90 compiler)
		You may need to specify the Fortran compiler
		vendor name with --with-F90-vendor=<name> where
		name is Absoft, Alpha, Cray, GNU, G95, IBMXL,
		Intel, Intel_7, Lahey, MIPSpro, NAG, PGI, or
		SUNWspro.
     Fortran 2003: GCC 4.6.1 or later, Intel 12.1.233 or later
     Java:      Sun Version 1.4 or higher.
	        Make sure your java bin directory occurs early
	        in your path.
		The combination of 
		Kaffe Version 1.1.5 (a Java-like virtual machine), 
		Jikes 1.22 (A Java compiler), and gjdoc (0.7.4)
		works (at least on a Debian system).
		(use --disable-java if you don't want Java)

  o  Make
     GNU make version 3.74 or above

  Babel now bundles CHASM-lite as part of the distribution.  CHASM
is a tool developed at LANL by Craig Rasmussen to provide Fortran
interoperability, and Babel uses it to access Fortran array
descriptors.  CHASM-lite is a small subset of the complete CHASM,
so if you want to explore the full chasm see 
http://chasm-interop.sourceforge.net/.

  In addition, the following are required to build the testing
framework:

     python:     (Needed only for the testing framework)


  Finally, if you want to build the Python tools and tests, you will
also need the specified version of Python.  If it is not found on
your system, the build process will skip the Python sections.

     Python:            Version 2.2 or higher
     NumPy:  		Version 1.0.4 or higher

Babel Runtime
=============

  Babel's runtime library can be downloaded, configured and installed
separately. Its configuration does not require Java. This is useful
in situation where you want to distribute pregenerated stubs with
your package.

Overview for the Impatient
==========================

  Assuming you are currently at the root of the package
directory and you have the necessary software and environment, 
simply type the following:

    $ ./configure --prefix=<InstallDir>
    $ make
    $ make install

where <InstallDir> is the directory into which you want the babel 
tool installed.  It is necessary to use the prefix option if you 
are not going to be installing Babel in the standard default 
location (i.e., /usr/local).  For example, given a subdirectory of
$HOME called "babel", the installation steps are:

    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/babel
    $ make
    $ make install

For more information on the prefix option, refer to the section
"Installation Names" below.

Note: If you are installing Babel directly from the SVN repository,
      you may also have to generate the 'configure' script, by running
 
      $ ./autotool_rebuild.sh 

   in the package root directory.

If you have trouble with the Java configuration, make sure your Java
bin directory is early in your path (e.g., before /usr/bin).

Basic Installation 
==================

  These are generic installation instructions.

  The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a 
file `config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

  If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README.md' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

  The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

  The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.


Compilers and Options
=====================

  Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:

    CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

    env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling with the Intel Compiler Suite on GNU/Linux
====================================================

  Babel can work with the Intel Compiler Suite version 7.0, but you
need to use the Intel Compiler Suite for everything (i.e., C, C++ and
F90). The only exception is G77 which seems to work fine with the
Intel Compiler Suite. If you want Python support, you need to compile
Python and Numeric Python with the Intel C compiler "icc -c99". To do
this correctly, you have to hack the Python build to produce a
libpython shared library (.so).

  Once you have a working Python compiled with icc, you can configure
Babel as follows (assuming the Intel compilers are in your path).

    CC="icc -c99" CXX=icpc F90='ifc -Vaxlib -C90' ./configure

  Some of our tests fail when we use ifc with g++ 2.96.

  If you use C++ and exceptions, you need to use CXXFLAGS=-cxxlib-icc
when you configure. We do not set this as the default because it breaks
Java interoperability.

Compiling Babel on AIX
======================
Here are the settings we use.compiler/

    #! /bin/sh
    JNI_INCLUDES=/usr/java140/include FC=newxlf90 \
    FCFLAGS='-qsuffix=f=f90 -qsuffix=cpp=F90' PYTHON=python2.2 \
    TEST=/usr/local/gnu/bin/test CC=newcc CFLAGS='-g' CXX=newxlC \
    CXXFLAGS='-g -qstaticinline -qrtti=all -qalias=noansi' F77=newf77 FFLAGS=-g \
    ../babel/configure $@

Expect the server side python to fail.

If you're compiling with the MPI compilers, the nopoe script in the
contrib directory may be helpful.

    #! /bin/sh
    JNI_INCLUDES=/usr/java140/include FC=mpxlf90 \
    FCFLAGS='-qsuffix=f=f90 -qsuffix=cpp=F90 -Wl,-bbigtoc' PYTHON=python \
    TEST=/usr/local/gnu/bin/test CC=mpcc CFLAGS='-g' CXX=mpCC \
    CXXFLAGS='-g -qstaticinline -qrtti=all -qalias=noansi' F77=mpf77 FFLAGS=-g \
    ../babel/contrib/nopoe ../babel/configure 

Compiling Babel with PGI's compilers
====================================

If you are getting an error message like 

    relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against `syscall@@GLIBC_2.2.5' 
	can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC 

or

    undefined reference to `__gcc_personality_v0' 

try to compile (but not configure!) Babel by running

    make LDFLAGS="-Wc,-nomp -Wl,-lgcc_eh"

this will pass the appropriate flags to the linker. You can't pass the
same flags to configure, because this will make tests for static
(non-libtool) linking fail.

Compiling Babel on Mac OSX
==========================
Mac OSX isn't a fully supported platform yet, but everything but
server side Python works in our testing.  We use gfortran 
and g77 from fink (see fink.sourceforge.net).

Compiling Babel on Solaris
==========================
You may need to set the SHELL environment to /bin/ksh if you see
error messages like 
	test: argument expected
when running Babel.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

  You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

  If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at 
a time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the 
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring 
for another architecture.


Installation Names
==================

  By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' 
the option `--prefix=PATH'.

  You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture-
specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you give 
`configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

  In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

  If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.


Optional Features
=================

  Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README.md' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

  For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.


Specifying the System Type
==========================

  There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

  If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.


Sharing Defaults
================

  If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.


Operation Controls
==================

  `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
